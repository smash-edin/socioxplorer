                                    that contain that keyword. For example, searching for "Messi" will limit the
                                    results to tweets/comments that contain the word "Messi". The search is not
                                    case-sensitive, so searching messi or Messi will return the same results, but it is
                                    sensitive to spelling, including special characters, so searching Mbapp√© or Mbappe
                                    will return different results. Some special characters may not be supported, for
                                    example, it is not possible to search for exclamation marks.

                                    You can also use more than one keyword and separate them with commas. If you do so,
                                    you will need to choose
                                    between "Any keyword" and "All keywords" to indicate how your keywords should be
                                    combined in the search. Selecting the option "Any keyword" (under the keyword field)
                                    will return all tweets/YouTube comments that contain any of the keywords: that is,
                                    they contain at least one of the keywords but not necessarily all of them. Selecting
                                    "All keywords", on the other hand, will only return tweets/YouTube comments that
                                    contain all of the keywords (although not necessarily in the same order as you
                                    enter them here). For example, searching "Messi, Ronaldo" and selecting "Any" will
                                    return tweets/comments that contain either of the two words. This allows you to
                                    compare how each of these two players is being mentioned. Selecting "All" will
                                    only return tweets/comments that contain both. This allows you to understand how
                                    they are mentioned together. Note that searching "Messi Ronaldo" will not return the
                                    same result at "Messi, Ronaldo": while in the latter "Messi" and "Ronaldo" are
                                    separate keywords, "Messi Ronaldo" would only return results that contain this
                                    whole phrase.

                                    other words, the latter essentially allows the analyst to filter the data based on
                                    users.

                                    inferred from the location authors declare as part of their profile. The "Tweet's

                                    shown as positive (i.e in green) if the data for this country contains more positive

                                    allows users to declare locations in two ways. Authors can declare a location for
                                    their account, in
                                    which case we assume all of their tweets share this location. Or authors can declare

                                    posting a specific tweet. Note that declaring a location is optional so the majority

                                            Communities will persist for new
                                            reports/queries. This can lead situations where the name of a community
                                            that was defined in the context of a specific search does not fit in the
                                            context of a different search. For instance: communities labelled in the
                                            context of a search focused on Messi might not make sense in the context
                                            of a search focused on Ronaldo. In general, we recommend that the user
                                            names communities while none of the filters are active (i.e. to provide the
                                            most general labels).

                                            The exact position of each user in the Social Network Analysis visualisation
                                            and the community each user is assigned to is re-processed each time data is
                                            added to the system (see "Pre-processing" section below). While we "align"
                                            communities across pre-processing timesteps, this means that communities
                                            can disappear. Moreover, community descriptions might become
                                            unrepresentative as communities morph. If you would like to save an exact
                                            snapshot of the current Social Network Analysis, we recommend saving the
                                            report using the "Save report" button at the top of the report. This can
                                            then be re-loaded from the "Load Report" page.

                            tweet) is labelled with one of the following sentiment labels: "Positive",
                            "Negative", "Neutral", "Non-Text" (e.g. punctuation or emojis) or "Other Language"
                            (if it not written in a language supported by the sentiment classification model).
                            The sentiment classification model used is <a

                            These are not exact coordinates but rather free-form descriptions provided by the Twitter
                            users. Moreover, tweets are sometimes tagged with an exact location.
                            As a pre-processing step, we match these descriptions and coordinated to countries using a
                            dictionary method (e.g. the description "Paris, France" is mapped to the country "France").
                            location extraction step is performed for new data without impacting data already in the

                            in semantic space (see "Analysis > H. Topic Discovery" section above) we need to
                            run two pre-processing steps. The first is to turn the text of each new
                            tweet/comment into a 768-dimensional vector representation called an embedding.
                            To do this, we use the <a
                            href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2" target="_blank">"all-mpnet-base-v2"

                            from the <a href="https://sbert.net/index.html" target="_blank">SBERT library</a>. This
                            model can be applied to new data without impacting data already in the system.

                            The second pre-processing step required is dimensionality
                            reduction: i.e. reducing the size of vectors from 768 to 5 dimensions, and then
                            to 2 dimensions. We do this because: 1) 768-dimensions embeddings would take a lot of space
                            in the Solr database are computationally and be inefficient to manipulate, whereas
                            5-dimensional ones take less space and are easier to manipulate while retaining much of the
                            information needed for clustering tweets/comments into topics, and 2) in the end
                            the visualisation shown to the analyst is in 2 dimensions. Normally, the dimensionality
                            reduction algorithm would consider the embeddings from the entirety of a dataset to
                            decide on the best way to reduce their dimensions without losing information.
                            However, this would be impossible to do with more than a few thousand datapoints.
                            Instead, we therefore use an approach called Parametric UMAP, which consists in
                            training a model on a subset of the data (~200K embeddings) and then applying it
                            to the rest of the dataset. This way, the dimensionality reduction model can also
                            be applied to new data without impacting data that is already in the system.

                            However, it is important to note that as time passes and the dataset grows, the new
                            data might increasingly differ from the one the dimensionality reduction model was
                            trained on. This would lead to poorer results in the Topic Discovery visualisation.
                            We therefore give the option to the user with admin access to the SocioXplorer dashboard
                            to explicitly request for the model to be retrained on a new random training sample
                            that includes more recent datapoints (see "Admin page" section above). This would
                            then cause the 5-dimensional and 2-dimensional representations of all tweets/
